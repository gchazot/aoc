# Advent of code solutions

These are my solutions to the amazing [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) coding challenge.
I've set myself a few rules for this challenge that I have mostly respected so far:
 * only use the standard Python Library
 * write code compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.7 (2016-2019), then 3.10 (2020+)
 * develop using TDD techniques and Clean Code principles
 
This whole thing is a playground to exercise my coding skills and knowledge of Python and
development tools, in the spirit of Craftsmanship.
